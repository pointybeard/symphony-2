# Symphony CMS (Extended)

- Version: 2.7.10
- Date: 29 March 2020
- [Github repository](https://github.com/pointybeard/symphonycms/tree/2.7.10-extended)
- [MIT Licence](https://github.com/pointybeard/symphonycms/blob/master/LICENCE)

## Overview

Symphony is a `PHP` & `MySQL` based CMS that utilises `XML` and `XSLT` as its core technologies. This repository is based on [Symphony CMS 2.7.10](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphonycms/tree/2.7.x) and is considered stable.

This specific fork of the official Symphony CMS 2.7.x release includes various quality of life improvements and changes. Most notably:

- Support for [JSON formatted config file](#2-json-formatted-config)
- Added [pre-boot scripts](#1-pre-boot-scripts) feature for custom boot behaviour
- [Removal of the all built-in fields](#3-removal-of-all-built-in-fields)
- [Support for additional XSLT processors](#4-support-for-additional-xslt-processors)

As well as other minor enhancements to the code base making future expansion of the core much easier.

This build will continue to be maintained against the official 2.7.10 LTS release.

## Server requirements

This build of Symphony CMS requirements differ slightly to the official release. Most notably, it will only run on PHP 7.2 or newer. It is suggested that your server is running at least PHP 7.3 to ensure full compatiblity with newer extensions.

## Installing

This version of Symphony CMS can be installed/upgraded as per any other 2.x installation. Please follow the instructions contained in the [official 2.7.x release README](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphonycms/blob/2.7.x/README.markdown).

## Features

Here are the most notable changes provided by this build of Symphony.

### 1. Pre-boot scripts

Pre-boot scripts are run prior to the core Symphony engine being instanciated.

Symphony will looks for the `symphony_preboot_config` path environment variable, which is a JSON file describing the scripts to include. Currently it only supports including additional files but in future it might include other tasks.

To use the pre-boot behaviour, follow these steps:

1. Set `symphony_enable_preboot` to `1` either via apache envvars or `.htaccess`
2. Set the path to the pre-boot JSON file with the `symphony_preboot_config` environment variable. E.g.

```
    SetEnv symphony_enable_preboot 1
    SetEnv symphony_preboot_config "/some/path/to/preboot.json"
```

3. Create the file specified by `symphony_preboot_config` and list files to include. Here is an example of a pre-boot config:

```json
{
    "includes": [
        "manifest/preboot/01_test.php",
        "/var/www/html/symphony/manifest/preboot/02_test.php"
    ]
}
```

Note, when pre-boot scripts are run, the Symphony core has not been initialised, i.e. there is no database connection and the main autoloader has not been included.

### 2. JSON formatted config

It is now expected that config will be a JSON file. Using JSON instead of an autogenerated PHP file makes loading, parsing, and saving the config much easier. Not to mention more readable.

### 3. Removal of all built-in fields

In effort to remove clutter and give developers the option of streamlining their builds even further, all of the built-in fields (Date, Input, Textarea, Select, Taglist, Author, Checkbox, and Upload) have been removed.

To add these fields back in, download and install the [Classic Fields Extension](https://github.com/pointybeard/classicfields). This extension lets you selectively install/uninstall any or all of these core fields as required.

### 4. Support for additional XSLT processors

This feature allows extensions to provide additional XSLT processor libaries which are then registered with Symphony and selectable in System Preferences. For example, [Saxon/C](https://github.com/pointybeard/saxon) adds XSLT 3.0 support.

## Why bother?

This build of Symphony CMS makes some fairly substantial changes which would be unlikely to be accepted back into the official repository.

The key reason this particular build was created was to support the development of [Orchestra](https://github.com/pointybeard/orchestra) which is a meta package for scaffolding and rapidly deploying Symphony CMS builds. Orchestra drastically changes the folder structure of Symphony and provides additional features that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.

This build of Symphony also makes extensions like [Saxon/C](https://github.com/pointybeard/saxon) possible, giving long overdue support for XSLT 3.0.
